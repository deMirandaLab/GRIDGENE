# REMOVE the 'src' line from here. We'll use this autosummary block
# when you have specific classes/functions/submodules to list.
# For now, 'automodule' will handle the full documentation.
# If you want to add specific top-level classes/functions later:

# .. autosummary::
#    :toctree: _autosummary/gridgen
#    :template: autosummary/class.rst
#    :nosignatures:
#
#    src.YourTopLevelClass
#    src.AnotherClass

# .. autosummary::
#    :toctree: _autosummary/gridgen
#    :template: autosummary/function.rst
#    :nosignatures:
#
#    src.your_top_level_function
#    src.another_function

# Sub-modules and more detailed content will go here once you are ready
# to document them, similar to what we discussed previously.
# For now, the 'automodule' above will list them implicitly if they are public members.
